In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a few rules have been communicated to reduce infections. 

1. Keep physical distance to other humans.
2. If you cough or sneeze, do it into your ellbow.
3. **Donâ€™t touch MEN: Mouth Eyes Nose**.
4. Wash hands with soap.
5. Wash surfaces with soap water. 
6. Wear face masks. Yes, they help.
7. Protect elderly people and those wo are at risk.
8. Don't hoard.
9. Be excellent to each other.

Here I want to focus on 3. 

To be clear. Do NOT do this:

Over the last couple of days, during videoconferences and on social media I have seen people constantly touching their faces. It happens subconsciously. Even if you tell people not to do it they will have their hand in their face a minute later. And so will you. This way a virus gets on a mucous membrane of yours and enters your body. 

The goal is to prototype a technical helper that gives a warning if your hand comes close to your head.
