Over the last couple of days, during videoconferences and on social media I have seen people constantly touching their faces. It happens subconsciously. Even if you tell people not to do it they will have their hand in their face a minute later. And so will you. This way the virus gets on a mucous membrane of yours and enters your body. 

To be clear. Do NOT do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgR6uaVqWsQ

The goal is to prototype a minimal helper that gives you a warning if your hand comes close to your face.
