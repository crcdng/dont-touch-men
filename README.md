# dont-touch-men

Uses hand detection &amp; face detection to alert people before they are touching their MEN (Mouth Eyes Nose).

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a few rules have been communicated to reduce infections. 

1. Keep social distance
2. If you cough or sneeze, do it into your ellbow
3. Donâ€™t touch your MEN: Mouth Eyes Nose
4. Wash hands with soap 
5. Wash surfaces with soap water 
6. Wear face masks 

I want to focus on 3. To be clear: 

Do NOT do this:

Over the last couple of days, during videoconferences and on social media I have seen people touching their faces all the time. It happens subconsciously. Even if you tell people not to do it they will have their hand in their face a minute later.

I want to try a little technical helper that gives a warning if your hand comes close to your head.
