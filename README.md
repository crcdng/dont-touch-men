Uses hand and face detection to alert people before they are touching MEN (Mouth Eyes Nose).

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a few rules have been communicated to reduce infections. 

1. Keep physical distance to other humans.
2. If you cough or sneeze, do it into your ellbow.
3. **Donâ€™t touch MEN: Mouth Eyes Nose**.
4. Wash hands with soap.
5. Wash surfaces with soap water. 
6. Wear face masks. Yes, they help.
7. Protect elderly people and those wo are at risk.
8. Don't hoard.
9. Be excellent to each other.

Over the last couple of days, during videoconferences and on social media I have seen people touching their faces all the time. It happens subconsciously. Even if you tell people not to do it they will have their hand in their face a minute later.

The goal is to prototype a little technical helper that gives a warning if your hand comes close to your head.
